The application keeps records of organizations.
Organizations are stored in the database and carry information about the company name,
country of registration and identification number (id).
To test the functionality, you need to connect a database management system
(postgreSQL was used in this application) and an HTTP client for API testing.
Example http request: http://localhost:8080/company/{...}

Example creat entity in the format JSON  :
{
    "company": "some name company",
    "country": "some country"
}
